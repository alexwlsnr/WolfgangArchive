<td class=s1><p align=justify>All those who know this site from the time back in <b>1997</b>, when is was published may wonder about the new design. But I thought that the time finally had come to give the pages a more modern outfit. Right in time, because the game was relaunced for the Gameboy Advanced as a part of a <b>Phantasy Star Collection</b>, containing three games (Phantasy Star, Phantasy Star II and last but not least Phantasy Star III).<br><br>The contents have not changed much, I only added the story of <b>Phantasy Star</b> as written in the original game manual. If I have some time left I will try to transfer this outfit on the pages for <b>Phantasy Star II</b> and <b>Phantasy Star IV</b> as well, but this will take more then just four days which I spent on rebuilding this site with the new design. Maybe a new section for the still missing <b>Phantasy Star III</b> will follow.</td>
