<td class=s3><p align=justify><b>Legendra's Creation.</b><br> 
The ancients tell of the time before Legendra, there was God, and his name was Toul. 
<br><br>
Toul is known as the father of all living things. Toul loved to create and give life to new things. However, he was alone. Toul decided to make helpers for himself. He created six beautiful Goddesses and six mighty gods. To the Goddesses he gave the power to create, and the power of destruction was granted to the gods. Toul was pleased with his creation, and he entered into a deep sleep. 
<br><br>
The Goddesses were given the power to create new life from the dust of space. They began to create a universe full of stars, moons and planets. These Goddesses placed all of these things under the control of the Star Dragon. 
<br><br>
The Star Dragon not only looked after the well-being of these celestial creations, but he was also worked with the gods to turn back some of the stars into dust. The Goddesses would then use this dust to create. This cycle continued for generations. 
<br><br>
Legend does state that once the six Goddesses and the six gods finish creation, Toul will awaken to view their creation. Thus Toul will be reborn. 
<br><br>
<b>The Legend of the Star Dragon </b>
<br>
By means of Toul's will, the Star Dragon and the stars were created. 
<br><br>
The Star Dragon's life is connected to the stars. With the help of the Goddesses, the Star Dragon governed over the vast universe that they created. However, the Star Dragon, with the help of the six gods, would also turn some of these stars back into dust. 
<br><br>
When all of the stars have returned to dust, the Star Dragon will also will turn to dust... 
<br><br>
<b>The Creation of Legendra </b><br>
--As recorded by the Elf Tribe 
<br><br>
<b>-The Birth of Legendra- </b><br>

This is the creation of Harsgalt, the Star Dragon. Harsgalt decided to create a star and his creation began to be known as Harsgalt's Star. 
<br><br>
The six Goddesses and Harsgalt began to bless the star by turning it into a beautiful planet. They divided the oceans and land began to appear over the surface of the planet. In the middle of the planet, there was a continent that was without equal. They called the land, "Legendra." Legendra was so enormous that the four seasons would take place somewhere on it all year round. Rivers began to emerge and the land began to be clothed with vegetation. 
<br><br>
<b>-The Age of Life- </b><br>
Astea, the foremost goddess, loved Legendra and blessed it. She felt that something else was needed to make Legendra truly beautiful. She then created three tribes: elves, humans, and beasts. Each tribe was created from the appearance of a god. 
<br><br><img src="events/astea.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" border="0" align=right hspace=20>
The Elf tribe was created first. Astea gave them the will to create and granted them a long life span. Secondly, Astea created humans. She gave them a strong will and the desire to change things for the better; however, they were only given a short life span. At last, Astea created the Beast tribe. The beasts were more barbaric looking than the other two tribes. Astea was pleased with her creation that she decreed that she would continue to bless them as long as they continued to live in peace. 
<br><br>
When the other Goddesses saw how beautiful the land of Legendra was, they left in search of a new star in which to create another world. However, Astea decided to stay and bless this land. 
<br><br>
Thus Legendra entered into a brilliant new era. 
<br><br>
<b>-The Invasion of Madruk-</b><br>
The land of Legendra became very appealing to the gods, especially Madruk. Madruk was the firstborn of the gods, and he believed his power was without equal. 
<br><br>
Madruk continued to look longingly at this world. With lust in his eyes, he began to desire to rule this world. He knew that only by destroying Astea and her sisters would he have enough power to destroy the other gods. Upon their death, he would claim their power. After claiming all of this power, he would then be strong enough to destroy Toul. 
<br><br>
Madruk brought forth fiends to destroy the tribes of Legendra; however, these tribes, despite their weak appearance, banded together. In many instances they proved stronger than Madruk's minions. 
<br><br>
Backed by Madruk's dark power, the fiends seemed to be without end. Astea pleaded for Harsgalt to help her save the land of Legendra. Harsgalt, however, refused to become directly involved in the conflict. However, as the cries of the people began to reach clear up to the heavens, Harsgalt decided to give eight Holy Warriors his dragon power. 
<br><br>
These eight warriors led the three tribes in an all out war against Madruk. They began to conquer the land that Madruk had ripped away from them. The tide of the battle began to change and the moral of the people of Legendra began to improve with each passing battle. 
<br><br>
<img src="events/ev113.jpg" width="288" height="136" alt="" border="0" hspace=20 align=left>However, in the heat of battle things began to go wrong. These eight warriors began to become haughty and arrogant. They began to take their power for granted. They felt that they were the ones responsible for saving the land. Each one began to lose sight of the escalating war and each began to desire to rule over Legendra as an all powerful monarch. 
<br><br>
Madruk's anger continued to blaze against the land of Legendra, due to the fact, that they were able to stand against such a mighty god. Madruk sent forth the dragonmen to destroy the people. These dragonmen were once used to turn stars back into dust. They were given the privilege of helping the Star Dragon and the gods; however, under Madruk's control, they began to grind the people into dust. 
<br><br>
With the hope of the people fading, the eight warriors refused to fight together. Clothed in pride, they each individually decide to attack these dragonmen by themselves. Astea pleaded with these warriors to work together. Only by their being united with the same mind and purpose could they ever have the hope of destroying these foul dragonmen. However, the warriors ignored her advice, and were slaughtered. Now with no one to come and lead them to victory the three tribes began to lose all hope. 
<br><br>
Astea again pleaded with Harsgalt to intervene and save the people of Legendra. Harsgalt's anger began to grow inside of him, and guilt began to eat away at his soul. He decided that he would help the people, but only briefly. Harsgalt came and sealed away the power of the dragonmen. Without their power, the dragonmen were defeated by the tribesmen. 
<br><br>
Madruk, again was outraged. The people of Legendra continued to fight, and in some cases they proved victorious over Madruk's agents of death. Madruk was so angered by these seemingly weak tribes that he entered the battle and began to turn the rivers red with the blood of the three tribes. 
<br><br>
<img src="events/ev057.jpg" width="288" height="136" alt="" border="0" align=right hspace=15>Without the help of the dragonmen, Madruk began to question his ability to achieve ultimate victory. However, Madruk's power eventually proved too strong for the people. The people thus cried to Astea for a miracle. In the darkest hour, Harsgalt lunged forth to save his world. Madruk knew that if he was able to kill the Star Dragon and claim his power, then he would have enough power to kill Astea and her sisters. 
<br><br>
During the battle, the winds howled, the land quaked and the oceans crashed. The battle between the Dark God and the mighty dragon lasted for one thousand days. The people watched in awe as these two battled for the destiny of their world. 
<br><br>
Madruk's power was beginning to fade, and Harsgalt's strength began to leave. In a rage of anger Madruk was able to unleash a stunning blow to Harsgalt, ripping the dragon's golden wing to shreds. Despite his critical injury, Harsgalt was able to deliver one last blow. Harsgalt charged forth and sank his fangs deep into Madruk's throat. 
<br><br>
Both Harsgalt and Madruk were unable to continue the fight. Harsgalt's injuries were to great to be ignored. In this weakened state he was unable to conjure up enough power to give the finishing blow to Madruk. 
<br><br>
Astea, who had given much of her power to Harsgalt, was also unable to kill the evil God. She was only able to give Harsgalt enough power to seal away Madruk until the time would come when eight chosen warriors would again emerge, this time to slay Madruk himself. 
<br><br>
The dragonmen, who were once used to aid Harsgalt and the six gods, where no longer sealed by Harsgalt's power. Astea decided that they could no longer stay in the land of Legendra. So Astea took pity on them and sealed them away in the another dimension inside Ruinledge Mountains. 
<br><br>
<img src="events/ev045.jpg" width="288" height="136" alt="" border="0" align=left hspace=20 vspace=20>Astea woke the eight ancient warriors from death and commanded them to wait for eight new warriors to be born. When these eight were to claim their power, the ancient warriors were to instruct them not to make the same mistakes that they did. Astea sealed the power of the eight warriors and gave it to Harsgalt, who held the Dragon Power ready for the Eight Warriors of the Dragon Force, who were soon to come. 
<br><br>
After completing all of her tasks, Astea did not have enough strength to leave this star or to call to her sisters for help. Astea then laid down and entered into a light sleep. She would sleep until the eight chosen warriors were born. With the help of these warriors, hopefully, Madruk could be destroyed...forever...
