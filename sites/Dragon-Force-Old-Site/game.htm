<td class=s3><div align="center"><img src="events/map.gif" width="550" height="436" alt="" border="0"></div><p align=justify>Dragon Force is a real-time Role-Playing Simulation game. The player selects a warlord to play from one of eight countries on the continent of Legendra. Two of the scenarios are only accessable after clearing the game once.<br><br>
The player, as the leader of a country, must eventually conquer all of Legendra by means of attacking other countries, forging alliances, and expanding territory by taking castles. The player accomplishes this by gaining experience for his sovereign and generals through battle experience. 
<br><br>
The game progression is by means of finishing a "field mode" and a "domestic affairs" mode repeatedly. Each time these two parts are completed, on week of game time has passed. In the field mode, the player sets strategies, captures captives, and expands territory by means of battle and alliances. In the domestic mode, awards for service are passed out, items are awarded to worthy generals, and castles are searched or fortified.

This game is quite addictive and will shave at least months off the players life while they remain engrossed in it, but it is very enjoyable. :) And it all depends on your strategy to bring back peace to a whole continent.
