I did not get the whole storyline and, of course, i know about the translated version of the game (IPS patch) that can be found in the internet. <br><br>But the ammount of text in the English version seems to have comsumed much more space than in the original Japanese version of the game. The IPS patch developers therefor seem to have decided to reduce the number of monsters in the game. If you want to see all monsters, you have to play the original version!<br><br></td></tr>

<td class="sch"><p align=justify><br>Before I come to the point, I want to talk about some differences between the gameplay of the original Phantasy Star and Phantasy Star Gaiden.
<br><br>
Due to the fact that Phantasy Star Gaiden was programmed for a Handheld Console it's a bit short. If you know what to do you normally can meet the main enemy within one day's play. That may be a bit disappointing but on the other hand it's understandable.
<br><br>
There is one thing that both games have in common. Like in nearly all RPG's you gain experience points and money by beating your enemies to dust. Unlike in Phantasy Star you don't have to open chests. This helps not being hit by arrows or being bombed to peaces.
<br><br>
The ammount of experience points you gain depends on the level a character has. Minina and Alec start at the same level so you will see this effect after Doromu, the dwarf, joins your party. There is a maximum of three persons within your group. If you meet other members, one of the original party will leave. You will have no control who shall be left behind.
<br><br>
The number of battles you will encounter is (that's my oppinion) much too high. But luckly you can retreat nearly every battle.<br><br>
