Far south from the cave the port town Karakatto can be visited. Buy the (&nbsp;<img src="hyoutan_aid.gif" width="83" height="11" alt="" border="0">&nbsp;) Hyoutan Aid here which is needed to 'convince' the guy Panin to let you enter the Peninsula ruins east of Karukatto. 
<br><br>
Search the ruins for a vehicle named (&nbsp;<img src="sand_master.gif" width="67" height="11" alt="" border="0">&nbsp;) Sandmaster. Now you can cross the desert to explore a huge terrain which could not be reached before.<img src="sand_master1.gif" width="32" height="15" alt="" border="0" hspace=20>
<br><br>
The first town you will see is Purimu. On the other side of the river you will see an other town. But due to the fact that neither Minina nor Alec can swim there is no way crossing the river. You have to try something completely different (remember Monty Python??). In Purimu you are told about the Mayoi forest, which is located south of the town. If you try to enter the forest for the first time you are 'warped' directly to the house in the center of the woods. There are three major things for you to do now.

<img src="../characters/meet_doromu.gif" width="160" height="80" alt="" border="0" align=left hspace=20>First you must find a dwarf in the southwest corner of the forest, return to the house with the dwarf, whose name is Doromu and finally find your way out! It is important to enter the house again because a so called 'Watergate Key' (sorry, Mr. Nixon) is stored here, too, which you will need to open the door to Cave 7.
