Now you can enter the cave in the southwest. At its end you may have seen a sort of machine if you visited the cave before. 
<br><br>
Approach the machine and this time the scene changes. You finally found Alis. You haven't even become familiar with Dalos and now he leaves the party and Alis will be the next member of the crew.

After leaving the cave, don't be too surprised: Alis has a driving licence and a cute pink car. Traveling could be much faster if those stupid monster won't wait nearly after every move. To avoid them for some quite minutes drive over water. Yes, the car changes automatically to a boat when touching the wet parts of the map. <br><br><img src="../enemies/kaburon01.gif" width="160" height="80" alt="" border="0" align=left hspace=15>Now you can explore the rest of the caves for some goddies like Laconian Shield, Lacinian Armor, and Laconian Sword. Equip Alis with the armory and cross the lake to find an island with a castle on it. Climb the top and face Kaburon, the main enemy of the game.
