<td class="sch"><p align=justify><br>Your characters will not learn magic spells like in Phantasy Star, even in higher levels, but you can buy them in the Magic Shops located in the towns and villages. You can sell them, too, which is a bit curious. So the spells are independent from the characters unlike you are used to in all other Phantasy Star games.
<br><br>
Even weapons and armor can be equipped by every party member. I noticed that the only reason why a certain weapon or armor can't be equipped is that the character's level seems to be too low. So in this case level up the character until the item can be equipped.
<br><br>
The puzzles of the game are straight forward. Even if your knowledge of the Japanes language is poor (like mine, of course) you will not have much problems beating the game.
<br><br>
This brings me to the last point before the walkthrough finally starts. You will have no guarantee that everything is translated or interpreted correctly in the walkthrough. I started learning Japanese in September '98 (1 1/2 hour every week) and still now I have to look for certain Hiragana or Katakana letters. Without the usage of a dictionary this walkthrough never would have become reality. And dictionaries usually have no RPG specific vocabulary, sorry. On the other hand, I am from Germany and left school more than 20 years ago now. So don't call me stupid if something in the walkthrough is totally wrong. You better should have a good laugh about the errors I made, and to tell the truth, who cares if you now can play a game which is totally written in Japanese! 
<br><br>
Enough smalltalk, let the walkthrough begin.
