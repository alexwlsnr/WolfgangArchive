You may have noticed the small note on foot of the start page which reads:<br><br><b>
&quot;All quoted text, logos, screenshots, and artwork copyright and courtesy Camelot Soft and Nintendo, Japan.&quot;</b>
<br><br>This in fact means two things: if Nintendo or Camelot Software Planning don't like seeing <br>their artwork presented here, I have to close this page. But during all the time since 1996 <br>I worked on my various pages I never had any problems with the companies who have <br>the original copyright. So I don't fear that the pages have to be closed.<br><br>
The second thing I would like to mention is more serious (if you see it with my eyes):<br>
You cannot imagine how many people in the Internet simply steal from other webpages <br>what they think they need to polish up their pages without any effort and hard work! <br>It always hurts when surfing around the web looking for pages about RPGs to find so <br>many familiar looking graphics and even text from the own website!<br><br>Due to the fact, that I don't have the copyright for the original artwork, I can't do anything <br>against these &quot;<b>bloody</b> web pi<b>rats</b>&quot;! I only can try to convince you with this little note of mine. <br><br>Don't steal but ask. I always give permission to use parts of my work to anyone who ASKS <br>me if he (she) may use my artwork. It only takes a short email (refer to the contact page for <br>details) to me, a small credit note on your page, and (only if you want to) a link from your site <br>to my pages!<br><br>Nothing more is needed to use my graphics on your own pages. Believe me, there are <br>some little tricks I know to make stealing from my pages more complicated, but I still <br>hope that this won't be neccessary!<br><br>But enough with this chit chat, surf, enjoy, and of course, contact me if you like!
