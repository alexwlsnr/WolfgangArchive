She, alongside Jenna, Kraden and Alex follows Saturos and Menardi to <br>the Venus Lighthouse. <br>Sheba is well known in Lalivero where she had lived before. It doesn't matter whom you ask<br> in Lalivero, all seem to be very worried about Sheba's vanishing. <br>A small troop of townsfolk even try to rescue her by following Saturos and Menardi into <br>the depth of the Tunnel Ruins underneath Babi Tower, but a door which cannot be opened <br>by nonadepts blocks their way.<br><br>Just before Isaac's party, who managed to solve the door problem, have to fight <br>Saturos and Menardi on top of the Venus Lighthouse it will be revealed that Sheba <br>is a wind adept like Ivan and really important to Saturos. She shall open the Jupiter <br>Lighthouse for him. Saturos even promises not to harm her if Ivan hands the Shaman <br>Staff over to him. Isaac and friends misunderstand this offer of Saturos as a promise to <br>set her free, but now is the moment for Felix to step forth and give Sheba a helping hand.<br><br>After Isaac's party finally have finished off the Fusion Dragon, the tower breaks apart and <br>Sheba falls of the top of Venus Lighthouse into the sea. Felix tries to rescue her and <br>jumps after her. Can both be saved?<br><br>Don't worry, you will see them once again in the epilogue section and, of course, in a <br>main role in the adventures of <b>Golden Sun 2</b> !</td>
