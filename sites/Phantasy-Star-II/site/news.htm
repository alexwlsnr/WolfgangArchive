This site was published first in 1997, and (with a short time of absence) was held online in its original design up to now. <br>But with the relaunch of the <b>Phantasy Star Collection</b> on the Gameboy Advanced I decided to overhaul the design to make it look more up to date. I am not quite sure, if it will please all of you, but it works for me!<br><br>So, enough chit chat, what can be found on this site?

<p><ol><img src="start logo.gif" width="240" height="160" alt="" border="0" align=right vspace=30>
<li>Total number of files in this section: 530 files<br>(ok, not that much as other sites I did!) <br><br>
<li>Enemies in the game: 119<br><br>
<li>Boss enemies: 3<br><br>
<li>Planets to explore: 2<br><br>
<li>Towns to visit: 8<br><br>
<li>Locations to explore: 20<br><br>
<li>Different items: too much, did not count them!<br><br>
<li>Midi files of the game: 33<br><br>
</ol>
<p align=justify>If you study the list above you surely will understand why I always mention: &quot;If you want to use some of the stuff, please ask me before doing so&quot;.<br><br>So, at last, enjoy surfing the site, maybe you will find something new. Oh when it comes to surfing this site, you can use the <b>Popup menu</b> seen above or, if you prefer <b>Sitemaps</b>, use the sitemap section instead. <img src="../design/space.gif" width=100 height=5 alt="" border="0"></td></tr></table>
