<td class=s1><p align=justify>After a severe headcrash of the harddisk of my computer, I had some trouble in making my Saturn emulator run again. So I could not work on a section I was planning for a long, long time. But today I want to present you the best part of the <b>Phantasy Star Collection</b>, which was published for the Sega Saturn back in 1998 by <b>Sega Ages</b>.<br><br>All owners know that the CD not only contained all four Phantasy Star games but four TV commercials which were to be seen in Japan. I think all fans of Phantasy Star will have seen them because they are published on many pages all over the net.</td>

<tr><td colspan=2>But there was still more: an <b>image gallery</b> of each game. <br>And I would like to present you these images in this section within my Phantasy Star pages.<br><br>Hope you like what you will find.
