<FONT COLOR="White">Welcome to the Unofficial Homepage of Lunar2 Eternal Blue.<BR> What can I tell you? Ok, don&#180;t expect to find all solutions for your problems on these pages. The main intention creating this site was to honor the joy and fun I had playing this marvelous game years ago on the Sega MegaCD. There is still no MegaCD Emulator available so I had to wait until I got my hands on a Playstaton version of Lunar2. Then it only took about <B>two months time</B> to create these pages.<BR>No more, no less.<P>The game still is not released in an English verson (Hurry up, Working Designs) so I had to use the Japanese game for my up to now largest project. And this is the main cause why I beg your pardon. My Japanese is not this good and, although the bleem! emulator did a marvelous job, it seems to me that it had problems displaying the whole range of Japanese letters. Only a small amount (Hiragana and Katana) were to be seen which made it nearly impossible to read the texts. It was like trying to read a newspaper after my dog has played with it for a while! You now may say that I should be used to it, but don&#180;t blame me, if there are some incorrect details to be found.<P>Time for some statistics? If not, click on the <B>SITEMAP</B> or any other button on the left, otherwise continue reading.
