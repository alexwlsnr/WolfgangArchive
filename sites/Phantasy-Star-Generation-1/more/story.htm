<p>The time: Space Century 342. <br>The place: the three planet Algol solar system located deep in the Andromeda galaxy.
<p>Under the democratic rule of King Lassic, life was good as he provided everthing his people could want. Space Travel had been discovered 200 years before and deep space shuttles has allowed the colonisation of Motavia and Dezoris, the other worlds of the Algol Star System.

<p>But slowly, over time, things began to change. It started with a new religion which was rumored to have come from another galaxy. The dark priests of this religion, never seen by any mortal, promised immortality to all who joined. You would live forever!<br>
King Lassic was getting old. The idea of living forever appealed to him so he became the first to join. <br>Then, he ... changed. It started with the threatening suit of armorthe priests made for him. The armor looked evil and corrpt, and that's how Lassic began to rule his people. Outrageous taxes became a burden on everyone. Business on all three planets shut down and entire towns fell into decay. There was no way for the people to make any money.
<br>As time passed and the people suffered, horible creatures and monsters began to stalk all three worlds. When the dead came back to life, the people feared the worst and guessed the truth. Through black magic, Lassic had become an evil tyrant. 
<p>But when there is evil there is also always good. Brave individuals began to rally in secret against Lassic. <br>But his Robotcops were ruthless in hunting out these defenders of the people.<br>One was Nero, a spaceport worker in Camineet, the central town on Palma. Long ago, his father had disappeared trying to learn Lassic's evil secrets.<br><br>Now, the Rotbotcops had crushed Nero as well. Before he died, he passed on hid sword and his quest <br>to his sister, Alis. He also told her to find a brave fighter named Odin.
<br>Alis raised the sword to the sky and vowed that Nero's death would not go unavenged!<br><br>And so the adventure begins ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Text: Original Phantasy Star manual, Master System, Sega, 1988)<br><br>
