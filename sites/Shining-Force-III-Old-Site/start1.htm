Hope you like what you see, but (if you see it with my eyes) the new pages are much better than the old once were.<br><br>The content is as it was, just some character pics and some intro screenshot of all three scenarios. But you now will find the names of all main characters of the game with some (more or sometimes less) interesting information.<br><br>As another new addition I would like to mention the Music section with various midi files of all three scenarios.</td>
