But don't get it wrong, <b>Piers</b> is a good one and was kept in his cell due to a big mistake. Try to gain his reputation back, find him for a second time and he will join you in your quest.<br><br><b>Piers</b> is a Mercury adept and seems to be very knowledgeable if it comes up to the legendary town of <b>Lemuria</b>. Maybe you will find out more once you travel the sea on a <b>Lemurian</b> ship, that indeed, belongs to <b>Piers</b> himself. Are the any more secrets he has to offer?<br><br>Due to my lack of knowledge of the Japanese language I cannot tell you much more about <b>Piers</b>, we have to wait until a translated English version is published for much more detailed character descriptions.</td>
