<td class=s1 valign=top><p align=justify>You reached the inner sanctum of <b>Gaia Rock</b>, the living-room of the <b>Orochi</b> dragon. Susa came here, too, and your party cannot do much more than helplessly watching his unsuccessful attack. Now its your turn to tell the dragon, that humans cannot be handled like this. It comes in handy that you opened the holes for the sunbeams. Maybe <b>Orochi</b> hates the sunlight, or he will be weakened by it, I don't know exactly.<br><br>Matter of fact is, that I could not beat the dragon until I opened all of the holes.<br><br>So it seems obvious that the strength of <b>Orochi</b> is intertwined with the darkness (maybe it is another supporter of &quot;You know Who&quot; aka &quot;Lord Voldemort&quot; aka &quot;Tom Riddle&quot; (oops, wrong story!!).<br><br>Nevertheless, once <b>Orochi</b> is killed, <b>Felix</b> gains the <b>SAND</b> psynergy, a useful new magic which will again help you to reach the &quot;unreachable&quot;. (Short hint: try you new magic in <b>Izumo Cave</b> and on the beach of <b>Apo jii</b>. You won't regret it!<br><br><img src="../../characters/uzume.gif" width="40" height="40" alt="" border="0" align=left hspace=10 vspace=3>Just one more thing, you don't need the <b>Dancing Idol</b> any more, so why not trade it for another much more useful Mars Djinn named <b>Turbo</b>. Simply offer it the majoress <b>Uzume</b> in <b>Izumo</b>.</td></tr>
