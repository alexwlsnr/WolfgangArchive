<td class=s1 valign=top><p align=justify>So that's the center of <b>Air's Rock</b>. <br><br>Your goal is to reach the bottom of the great hall to use <b>WHIRLWIND</b> on the pinkish whirl symbol. This will take some time because you have to visit many rooms from here. <br><br>From the upper level two doors go to the right and left. Try the right door first.<br><br>The next time you enter here it will be one level down on the right. Now cross over to the left and enter the doorway.<br><br>Back again here you are standing in front of the third level door. Hop over the gap, climb down the ladder and use the doorway down next to the huge face which is lying on the ground with its face showing up.<br><br>After a short visit in the room with a huge psynergy crystal use <b>WHIRLWIND</b> on the symbol to let the face below blow at last. Step onto it and you will be blown up back to the first cave part where you entered the <b>Air's Rock</b>. In here use <b>WHIRLWIND</b> at the symbol again and leave the room through the door top left. You are back on the top level of the center dome. This time, use the door to the left.<br><br>After a long journey through the left part of the dungeon, you will come back here through the bottom door on the left. Let yourself be carried over to the right by the stone statue and then climb up the ladders to the right.<br><br>Use the floating step stones to reach the huge block in the center of the dome. A door will open and you have finally reached the inner sanctum of <b>Air's Rock</b>.<br><br>By the way, the doorway at the bottom of the dome room will lead you outside the mountain to the door you might have noticed on your way up the monolith.</td></tr>
