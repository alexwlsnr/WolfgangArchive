<TD COLSPAN=2><FONT SIZE=2><BR>Use the <B>SPEED POTION</B> on any character you like. It will level up the speed value by 1. Normally it should be translated as Motion Potion, which somehow reads more funny, but then the text would not fit into the screenshot window.<P>The <B>SACRED BOOK</B> should be given to healers like Pauline or Paris. They then will be promoted to the <B>Bishop</B> class. More spells are available within the Bishop class.<P>If the <B>MAGE TRICKS</B> are donated to Puppy and Too, they are promoted to <B>Wizards</B> and you can buy more powerful spells in the next magic shop, too.<P>If you can get your hands on the <B>MONSTERGUIDE</B>, give it either to Puppy or Too for a promotion to the <B>Summoner</B> class. although he/she looses their magic spells, the character now can summon all monsters which were tamed by Eva before.<P>I have not found out what can be done with the <B>BOTTLE OF ZUU</B> or the <B>CROP OF ENGUS</B> items. They can neither be equipped nor can they be given to any character or monster.</TD>
