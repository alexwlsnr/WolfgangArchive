I must say you do look pretty tired and, well,
your things have seen better days.

Well, how about right here?
Lend your hands to the fields of our village? 
<br><br>
<b class="white">That sounds like just what I need right now.<br>
I work hard and I'm a fast learner.</b> 
<br><br>
Good! We've got a deal then. <br>Folks in the village will be excited to see a new face! <br>I didn't catch your name. What do they call you?
