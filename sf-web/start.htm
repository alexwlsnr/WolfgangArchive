<tr><td class=s1 width=500><br><p align=justify>From time to time &quot;good&quot; pages in the www need to be improved, too. <br><br>After being online now for 5 years in its original outfit, the <b>Home of Shining Force</b> pages were a bit outdated in design and navigation. So I decided to rebuild them in a new outfit. Fans of the former pages might miss some details (like the inside screenshots of the buildings) but they were not really neccessary. On the other hand, I tried to improve the navigation a bit, because you easily could get lost on the old pages. But decide for yourself. <br><br>About the game <b>Shining Force</b>, what can I tell much more? All fans of this series loved it for its gameplay and the wonderful detailed graphics. This game started a whole new series of strategic based RPGs and offered brilliant pictures never seen before on the Genesis / Megadrive up to the year<b>1993</b> when the game was published. <br><br>Yes, the game has its 10 years anniversary this year, so the new design can be taken as a birthday present for the game as well!<br><br><span class="footer">JAVA-Script code included, enable Java-Script on your browser.<br>Designed for a resolution of 800 x 600 pixels and 65.000 colors. <p>All quoted text, logos, screen shots, and artwork copyright and courtesy Sega, Japan.<br><img src="design/space.gif" width=400 height=20 alt="" border="0"></td><td width=250 align=center class=s1><img src="more/sf-logo.gif" width="238" height="105" alt="" border="0"><br><br><img src="more/sega.gif" width="193" height="65" alt="" border="0"><br><br><img src="more/sonic_team_logo.gif" width="249" height="96" alt="" border="0">
