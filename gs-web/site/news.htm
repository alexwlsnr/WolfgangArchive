<p>First of all, welcome to the Unofficial Home of the Golden Sun. What can I say?, Ok, this page is no real News page as you might be used to. Mainly you will find some statistics about the game and the site itself. I do not plan a regular or continuous update of these pages unless you will tell me what's totally wrong (except the orthography, of course) or what's missing. <br><br>In the near future I would like to built a special section about the Colosso Tournament, which is still missing, I know that! <br>In fact, I &quot;hate&quot; Colosso! Did you ever try to make screenshots and reach the fighting place first at the same time? If not, you cannot imagine what pain the Colosso Tournament is!<p>So, enough chit chat, what can be found on this site?

<p><ol>
<li>Total number of files in this section: 1,373 files 
<li>Enemies in the game: 115
<li>Boss enemies: 13 
<li>Towns and places to visit: 14 
<li>Locations (buildings, caves, countrysides) to explore: 23 
<li>Battle backgrounds: 36 
<li>Weapons: 51 
<li>Armory, etc: 84 
<li>Other Items: 60

</ol>
<p>If you study the list above you surely will understand why I always mention: ´If you want to use some of the stuff, please ask me before doing so´. Details about what to do if you need some stuff from this pages can be found in the <b>Copyright</b> section.<br><br>So, at last, enjoy surfing the site, maybe you will find something new!, Oh when it comes to surfing this site, you can use the <b>Popup menu</b> seen above or, if you prefer <b>Sitemaps</b>, use the sitemap section instead.
