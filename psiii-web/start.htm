<td class=s1><p align=justify>This is one of the most disappointing moments in my RPG carrier. <br><br>Wonder why? To tell the truth, I didn´t like the game much when playing it in 1991. Something was wrong with it. <br><br>Now, trying to build up the section, I discovered the cause. It´s the lack of effort programmers showed. I didn´t find more than TWO animation phases at any of the few foes shown here. <br><br>Seeing what the monster designers did in Phantasy Star I, II and IV, Phantasy Star III must be the work of novice programmers. Only the music composer, Ippo, did a good job. <br><br>I´m sorry, I will NOT finish this section. Maybe someone else wants to, but surely not me, allthough I am not quite sure about that now!</td>
