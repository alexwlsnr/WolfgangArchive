<td class=s1><p align=justify>If I am asked which game of the Phantasy Star series I like most, it would be a bit complicated to answer at once. I started my 'career' as a RPG player on game consoles with <b>Phantasy Star</b> on the Master System back in 1988 and it will have a special place in my memory forever.<br><br>But to tell the truth, my favourite game of the series is <b>Phantasy Star IV</b>. It it so rich of details, has a heart warming story, love, adventure and even sorrow. <br><br>True fans of all former games Phantasy Star IV will find details of the previous adventures so often, that you soon feel familiar, as if you have come home after such a long time. Described with just one word, this game indeed is simply &nbsp;<b>MARVELOUS</b>.</td>
