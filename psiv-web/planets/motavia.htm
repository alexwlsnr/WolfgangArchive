<td class=s1><p align=justify>This is the map of Motavia, the main planet of the Algol Solar system. Many things can be found here due to the rich history of this ancient planet. For all those who are not so involved in the story: <br><br>2,000 years ago an esper named <b>Noah</b>, who lived on this planet in the <b>Naharu</b> cave was found by <b>Alis</b>, the heroine of Phantasy Star I. Even a village called <b>Uzo</b> existed in these times. <br><br>1,000 years ago, when <b>Rolf</b> and his friends started their adventure on this planet, the two towns <b>Piata</b> and <b>Zema</b> were full of people in fear of what would creep out of the depths from inside a <b>Biosystem Laboratory</b>, which played a mayor role in Rolfs quest.<br><br>
