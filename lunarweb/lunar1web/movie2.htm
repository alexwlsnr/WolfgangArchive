<TD COLSPAN=2><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="MS Sans Serif">Don&#180;t expect too much. I was not able to put the movies as an AVI format or animated GIF into the World Wide Web.<P>Believe me, I tried, but the mass of data is so enormous that no one could afford to pay the telephone bills for the download times!<P>I converted the Meribia Arrival Movie to AVI as a test. <P>It is a short one (288 single frames), but even this movie had <B>9.2MB</B> data in a good quality and about <B>2.5MB</B> in the highest compression mode, which looks like the example shown below.<BR>
<P>If you are a pixel enthusiast you might be happy with a movie in this quality.<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="avi-test.jpg" WIDTH=222 HEIGHT=190 BORDER=0></CENTER><P>So I decided to put some example pics of each movie to reduce the data transfer. I hope you will agree!</FONT></TD></TR>
