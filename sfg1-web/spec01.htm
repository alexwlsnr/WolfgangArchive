<TD><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=0 WIDTH=460><TR><TD><FONT SIZE=0 FACE="MS Sans Serif">Hello, Fans of the Shining Force series all over the world. Again, it&#180;s a premiere worldwide. I tried to animate all heroes, enemies, and some other stuff of the two Shining Force games available for the SEGA Game Gear. Both games were published for the Game Gear in Japan only. <BR>Shame on you, SEGA of America and SEGA of Europe!<BR>When surfing these pages you will see, that they really were worth being published worldwide. <P>Meanwhile, one of the games, the Sword of Hajya, was completely translated in English by a group of true SF fans. Sadly, it&#180;s not available for the Game Gear but can be played only on a PC with an Master System / Game Gear emulator like Massage, Master Gear or similar.
<P>The Sword of Haiya is one of the three games which can be played on the Sega Mega CD, too. In fact, it is the second episode. I used the translated version for creating these pages.
<P>The next Shining Force Game Gear episode, The Final Conflict, never managed to cross the &#180;language frontiers&#180;. But, since I started to learn Japanese in September, I tried to translate some of the stuff for you. Perhaps it&#180;s a bit easier now for those of you who can&#180;t read the Japanese letters. But beware, don&#180;t expect to much. I only was able to translate names and the items which can be bought or found. The storyline stays a secret for me, maybe some more time of studying the language will help in the future. Also, some secret characters are missing, but I try to find them.
<P>If you want to use the graphics, contact me at <A HREF="mailto:wl@seh.de">wl@seh.de</A> instead of simply &#180;stealing&#180; them. <P>And, always keep in mind, the graphics you will see were displayed on an 8 Bit machine !!!
