He will not join you here but once you finished your duty on top of the lighthouse, don't miss him in the town of <b>Contigo</b> southeast of the Jupiter Lighthouse. <br><br>In one of the houses <b>Isaac</b> will wait for you and after a conversation, which I could not follow (sorry about that) he and his party will join <b>Felix</b> and friends. <br><br>This will finally give you the control over eight heroes in total, you can mix the parties and use all psynergies. With the help of <b>LIFT</b> and <b>FORCE</b>, for example, you can enter places which you could never have dreamed of reaching before!</td>
