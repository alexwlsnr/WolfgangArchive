Her name is <b>Mia</b> and she lived in the small village of <b>Imil</b> next to the Mercury Lighthouse. <br><br>She was supposed to watch over the lighthouse together with <b>Alex</b>, but <b>Alex</b> quitted his job and changed sides. He then roamed the land together with Saturos and Menardi. <br><br>This was the main reason why <b>Mia</b> decided to join <b>Isaac</b> and friends. She felt responsible for what <b>Alex</b> was doing and wanted to help. This, more than any other fact, shows her kindness. <br><br>So, guys in the party, be nice, maybe you will have a chance!</td>
