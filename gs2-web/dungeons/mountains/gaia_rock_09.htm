<td class=s1 valign=top><p align=justify>The time has come to finally enter the center doorway of the entrance room. Once being inside this part of the dungeon, all those of you who helped Isaac and friends through the <b>Mogall Forest</b> in the first adventure might remember well that you could walk there for hours without finding the exit.<br><br>This part of <b>Gaia Rock</b> is very similar to the forest mentioned above, but luckily, the trick to overcome this &quot;obstacle&quot; is the same.<br><br>Every time you take the wrong turn, you will soon notice, because the room you will enter looks exactly like the room you just left. So try each turn and as long as the surroundings are different, you are on the right way. If not, simply try a different route until you notice a change.<br><br>Best way to beat this maze, however, is to use the map to the left.<br><br>Get the <b>Rusty Mace</b> and, if you like <b>Mimics</b>, fight the one you will find in here. After a while you will leave the maze and continue to the next and last room.</td></tr>
