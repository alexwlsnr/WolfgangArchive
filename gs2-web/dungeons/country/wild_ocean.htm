You found the <b>Sea of Time</b>. Enter from the south and soon you are confronted with whirling spots and areas of currents which wash your ship back to the entrance.<br><br>There must be a trick to cross the wild ocean up to the northwest exit. All those of you who traveled to the village of <b>Yallam</b>, known as the village of the blacksmith, might have seen some children playing in the eastern part of the town. If you joined their play and watched closely, you might have noticed what to do to master <b>Sea of Time</b>.<br><br>If not here is a short explanation: <br>The tree stumps symbolyze small volcanos which have to be circled several times. A current next to this volcano then will stop flowing, giving you some time to cross. But hurry, if your ship is still on the current when it starts flowing again, you will be washed away and have to start all over from the entrance!<br><br>One thing can be learned, too. You should listen to children more often!</p><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0" bgcolor="#c0c0c0">
