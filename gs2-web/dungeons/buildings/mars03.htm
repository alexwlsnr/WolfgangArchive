<tr><td colspan=6 class=s1><p align=justify>This is the first sublevel of <b>Mars Lighthouse</b>. Like in the <b>Jupiter Lighthouse</b>, you have to visit some floors more than once.<br><br>a) You have used the stair <b>(3)</b> and find yourself in a room which floor is partially covered with ice. There are two door where you can exit. Take the door to the left first and venture forth until you stand next to a torch. Use <b>Prominence</b> here and the dragon head will be activated once, creating a crack in the ice block seen below. Now trace back and glide over the ice to the right, then take the doorway down again.<br><br>Ignore investigating the iceblock, better walk right into the next room. This room is blocked by several smaller ice pillars. Once again, the dragon head will solve the problem after being lit by <b>Prominence</b>.  The ice will melt and your way is free. The next dungeon part has three doors. After getting a <b>Golden Ore</b> from the room in the middle use the door to the right. Inside a rumbling can be heard and from time to time a huge fireball will blast down the hall. Your destination, sad to say so, lies to the top right, you have to reach another door without being hit by the fireball.<br><br>Use <b>POUND</b> on all ice pillars to create some &quot;hideouts&quot;. Now run (B-Button) up and hide from time to time and you will enter the door easily. Follow the hallway and enter a new ice cowered room. <b>MOVE</b> the dragon statue to the left, meet the Mercury Djinn <b>Thallasso</b> and exit the room via the stairs <b>(4)</b>. You have returned to the room with the mysterious circle symbols on the floor.<br><br>b) When being here for the second time examine the cracked iceblock to the left, use <b>BURST</b> on it to free a blocked doorway. <b>REVEAL</b> the truth behind the circled stones and use <b>TRANSPORT</b> to be warped to the circle in the room where you have obtained the <b>Golden Ore</b>. Now take the stairs to the next floor.</td></tr>
