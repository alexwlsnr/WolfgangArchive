<tr><td colspan=3 valign=top class=s1><p align=justify>The village chief <b>Moapa</b> will wait for you to let the trial begin. Before you can start you have to convince him of your <b>Psynergy</b> potential. This task is very simple to fulfill. Use <b>WHIRLWIND</b> on the pink symbol as you did it several times when visiting <b>Air's Rock</b>. This will blow away the sand barrier in front of the trial path, too. First get the <b>Hard Nut</b> from the chest on the left cliff, then approach <b>Moapa</b>.<br><br>The trial, in fact, is a run to the top of the <b>Shaman Hill</b> itself against <b>Moapa</b> and his <b>Senjis</b>. Your task is to reach the top of each level first and step on the blue symbol next to the door! <br><br>In case you managed to win the level, you have to put <b>one</b> equipment (armor, headgear or weapon) into one of the chests at the top. If you failed winning the level, you are forced to unequip <b>two</b> items! <br><br>After you gave away your stuff, the door to the next level will open and the race continues. To avoid reaching the top &quot;bare handed&quot; you have to be really fast. And the more equipment you have, the better the chances are to beat <b>Moapa</b> and his friends in the final battle on <b>Shaman Hill.</b><br><br>If you think your winning chances are bad, simply step on the red symbol on each level to restart the trial once again! Don't fear to loose your equipment, you will get back everything once you have won!<br><br>The last two tips before you start: Take the left trial, the puzzles are far easier to solve than those of the right trial. And don't bother about the chests on each level, you can return here and collect all goodies afterwards!
