<p align=justify>First of all, welcome to the Unofficial Home of the Golden Sun 2". What can I say?, Ok, this page is no real News page as you might be used to. Mainly you will find some statistics about the game and the site itself. I do not plan a regular or continuous update of these pages unless you will tell me what's totally wrong (except the orthography, of course) or what's missing. <br><br>Due to the fact that I lost some of my notes, maybe something is missing, but don't blame me, if you found something incorrect, please tell me, i then will try to correct it. And the main problem again, was the Japanese language. So, after the english version is published I will play all over again not only to fill in the missing facts and items but to enjoy the game itself!<p>So, enough chit chat, what can be found on this site?

<p align=justify>If you study the list above you surely will understand why I always mention: &quot;If you want to use some of the stuff, please ask me before doing so&quot;. It took me 4 months work to put on this site for your enjoyment. I don't even earn one cent for creating these pages! Details about what to do if you need some stuff from this pages can be found in the <b>Copyright</b> section.<br><br>So, at last, enjoy surfing the site, maybe you will find something new, Oh when it comes to surfing this site, you can use the <b>Popup menu</b> seen above or, if you prefer <b>Sitemaps</b>, use the sitemap section instead.
