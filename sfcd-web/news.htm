But the wait is over. Surf around, look at all the new stuff and enjoy. <p>I hope that what you see will please you and that it will be a nice reward for you, who begin to ask themselves if the Home of the Shining Force ever would be updated again in their life.<p>And, as usual, if you need some of the stuff of these pages, please send a short request to <A HREF="mailto:wl@seh.de">wl@seh.de</A>. Thank you!</td>
