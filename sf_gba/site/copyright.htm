<tr><td colspan=3><table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td class=s1><br><p align=justify><br>Please, take some time to read this little note about the copyright of this Golden Sun website!<br><br>
You may have noticed the small note on foot of the start page which reads:<br><br><b>
&quot;All text, logos, screenshots, and artwork copyright and courtesy Sega, Japan.&quot;</b>
<br><br>This in fact means two things: if Sega  does not like seeing the artwork presented here, I have to close this page. But during all the time since 1997 I worked on my various pages I never had any problems with the companies who have the original copyright. All stuff you will see here is online since 1998 and I never got a note from Sega odr Camelot! So I don't fear that the pages have to be closed.<br><br>
The second thing I would like to mention is more serious (if you see it with my eyes):<br>
You cannot imagine how many people in the Internet simply steal from other webpages what they think they need to polish up their pages without any effort and hard work! It always hurts when surfing around the web looking for pages about RPGs to find so many familiar looking graphics and even text from the own website!<br><br>Due to the fact, that I don't have the copyright for the original artwork, I can't do anything against these &quot;<b>bloody</b> web pi<b>rats</b>&quot;! I only can try to convince you with this little note of mine. <br><br>Don't steal but ask. I always give permission to use parts of my work to anyone who ASKS me if he (she) may use my artwork. It only takes a short email (refer to the contact page for details) to me, a small credit note on your page, and (only if you want to) a link from your site to my pages!<br><br>Nothing more is needed to use my graphics on your own pages. Believe me, there are some little tricks I know to make stealing from my pages more complicated, but I still hope that this won't be neccessary!<br><br>But enough with this chit chat, surf, enjoy, and of course, contact me if you like!</td></tr></table>
