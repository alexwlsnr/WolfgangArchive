<td class="sch"><p align=justify><br>The next town you reach south of the bridge is Mechatron. Here you can buy better equipment. If you like you can try to explore your first cave. It lies in the northwest corner. Use the northern entrance and get a feeling for those creepy locations.<br><br> 
Use Searchlights or, far better the (&nbsp;<img src="light_pendant.gif" width="88" height="11" alt="" border="0">&nbsp;) Light Pendant. The light lasts longer, can be used as often as needed, and is for free. The searchlight costs money and can be used only once!
<br><br>
In the chest inside the cave you will find the book of truth. Show the book to Robu in Tedo.

<img src="../enemies/popo.gif" width="25" height="48" alt="" border="0" align=left hspace=15>You will see a locked door in the cave, too. So there must be something behind it. After a continous level up and equipped with better armory (can be bought in Taini, the village south of the southern entrance of the cave to the northwest, what a stupid description for this location) you can try to explore the rest of the cave. The entrance is blocked by this guy.

I think is the archeologist Poppo or one of his followers, but I am not sure about this. Be it as it be, you gain a worldmap from Poppo, after he is beaten. In the chest a key for the door inside the cave can be found. But it is useless now.
