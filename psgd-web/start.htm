<td class=s1><p align=justify>Did you ever try to play a game and had no chance to do so? For me, a dream finally came true. At last, I found a copy of the game, I wished to solve for more than seven years now!<br><br>
The name of the game? <b>Phantasy Star Gaiden</b>! 
<br><br>
Ok, I did not understand much (all in Japanese, of course) but it was fun nonetheless. For all those of you who have trouble beating this game, I made some screenshots. Mainly maps, towns, enemies, and, ... and so on. And for those of you whose Japanese to more worse than mine Itried to translate all the items, which can be found in the shops (incl. magic).<br><br>All I found usefull might be the same for you. So relax and surf. Sorry, the enemies are not animated this time, but there was nothing to animate with one exception. It's the main enemy, <b>KABURON</b>.
